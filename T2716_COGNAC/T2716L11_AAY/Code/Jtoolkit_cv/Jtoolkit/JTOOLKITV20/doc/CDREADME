VIII. Step by step instructions for using IPSetup    

      A) Open the product CD by double-clicking on the CD drive.

      B) Click the "View the Readme File" button. Setup opens the
         README.TXT file in Notepad. Be sure to review the entire
         file before proceeding further.

      C) Click the "Run IPSetup" button to launch IPSetup. The
         program displays a Welcome Screen and a License Agreement
         screen. To continue the installation, click Next on each
         of these screens.

      D) If you decide to use DSM/SCM to move files to Installation 
         Subvolumes (ISVs) after files are placed on the NonStop system,
         Check the option "Use DSM/SCM to complete installation on host".
         Uncheck this option if you do not wish to use DSM/SCM.

         Using DSM/SCM is optional, but is recommended when DSM/SCM is 
	 available.

      E) On the "Product Selection" screen, highlight the product to be 
         installed from the available product list and click Add to 
         select the product:

            HP JToolkit for NonStop Servers

         Click Next.

      F) Log on with an userid that has required permissions, by
         following the instructions on the "Host Information"
         screen. You can use either the system name or the system
         IP address to log on. Click Next.

      G) On the "Host Target Settings" screen, you can either accept
         the default locations for the Work subvolume and Backup
         subvolume or browse the locations of your choice.
         Click Next.

      H) On the "Host File Placement" screen, you can either accept
         the default disk locations or browse to locations of your
         choice. Click Next.

      I) On the "Placement Manifest" screen, review the file
         locations. You can click the Back button to go back and
         change them. Click Next.

      J) On the "Placement Complete" screen, you can choose the
         check box to view the release documentation. It is
         recommended that you should review the release
         documentation. Click Finish to complete running the 
         IPSetup.

      K) Once the product files have been successfully moved to
         the DSV locations on the NonStop system by using IPSetup,
         follow the installation instructions in product softdoc
         to complete the product installation.                       

IX. Manual placement of product files  

    NOTE: Skip this step if IPSetup has successfully placed the
    files onto your NonStop Kernel system.

    A) Navigate to the subdirectory NSK_SW on the CD-ROM.

    B) The files you need to move, including SETUPRUN and NSKUNPK,
       as well as the IPSetup readme file are located on your
       IP CD-ROM in the following directory:

          NSK_SW\TOOLS\RISC

    C) Navigate to the subdirectory TOOLS\RISC and use an ASCII file 
       transfer mechanism (such as FTP) to move the file SETUPRUN to 
       a location (such as $<vol>.R2716AAE) on the destination 
       NonStop Kernel system.
 
       Where <vol> is the volume where the product is to be installed.

    D) Move the files NSKUNPK and FILEMGR in this subdirectory
       by using a BINARY file transfer mechanism (such as FTP) to
       the same location in which you placed SETUPRUN.                     

    E) The product files are located in the directory NSK_SW\SJ76V2\RISC.
       Navigate to the product subdirectory and move all the files 
       in this subdirectory by using a BINARY file transfer mechanism 
       (such as FTP) to the same location in which you placed SETUPRUN.

    F) Logon to the NonStop system as SUPER.SUPER:

         TACL> LOGON SUPER.SUPER

    G) Go to the subvolume containing the transferred files and
       run SETUPRUN TACL macro:

       TACL> VOLUME <$volume>.<subvolume>
       TACL> SETUPRUN

       SETUPRUN performs the following tasks:

         1. Runs NSKUNPK, which transforms each packed file back
            to its DSV format.

         2. Creates a DSVLOCS file, which contains a list of
            locations where each DSV was placed.

         3. Purges the packed file after successful placement.

         NOTE: You must restore a packed DSV in its entirety;
         you cannot restore only some of the files.                                 
     H) Enter N when SETUPRUN prompts for renaming the DSV
        locations:

        Do you want to rename any of the DSVs that were
        placed (Y/N)?N

     I) SETUPRUN indicates if it completed successfully.

        If all files were unpacked successfully, SETUPRUN
        displays the following message before it finishes:

        ------------------------------------------
        -- ALL FILES HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY PLACED --
        ------------------------------------------

        If not all files were unpacked successfully, SETUPRUN
        displays the following message before it finishes:

        ----------------------------------------------------
        -- xxxx OF xxxx PACKAGES WERE SUCCESSFULLY PLACED --              
        ----------------------------------------------------

        Correct any problems if indicated. Refer to the
        Troubleshooting Tips section in the USRGUIDE.PDF
        included in the product CD.

     K) Once the product files have been successfully moved to
        the DSV locations on the NonStop system by using SETUPRUN,
        follow the installation instructions in each product's
        softdoc to complete the product installation.
