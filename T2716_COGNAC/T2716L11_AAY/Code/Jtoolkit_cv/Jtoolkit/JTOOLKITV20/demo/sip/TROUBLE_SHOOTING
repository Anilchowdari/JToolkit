The following lists some possible problems that you might have with SIP 
or the sip configuration tool and also suggests solutions.

THE CLIENT HANGS ON ITS FIRST CONNECTION WITH SIP

1. Check that you have configured the right port number.

   a. If your SIP server requires a port number(s) as an argument when 
      run outside of SIP, use the Management Tool to verify that you 
      have included the port number(s) in the arglist data entry for 
      the SIP server. To use the Management Tool, enter your
      configuration directory and click on Management Tool.  When the 
      table appears listing all the applications configured in your 
      configuration directory, click on the SIP serverclass to which 
      the client is trying to connect.

2. Use the SIP Management Tool or Pathcom to verify that your SIP server 
   is running. The server may fail to run because java can't find the 
   .class file, the class path is specified incorrectly, or ...  If an 
   error occurs with your SIP server, information is written to a file 
   in the directory you specified for your logpath.  This file has
   the format:

		<pathmonName><serverclassName>.errlog

	Examine this file for error messages and correct any error found.

3. Verify that the ptcp/ip process or tcp/ipv6 process you specified when 
   configuring the SIP server actually exists.

A CLIENT HANGS ON A SUBSEQUENT CONNECTION WITH SIP

1. Verify that your SIP server closes the socket with which it communicates 
   with the client. 

2. If a client connects and disconnects from the same SIP server, verify 
   that the client closes sockets after each disconnection.


WHILE RECONFIGURING/STOPPING/STARTING A SERVERCLASS,
SIPCONF RETURNS THE MESSAGE: OBJECT IS IN THE WRONG STATE

Use pathcom to manually freeze/stop the distributor associated with the SIP
server; then use pathcom to manually freeze/stop the SIP Server. This can 
happen when the SIP server starts and then stops because Java encounters an 
error. Check the errlog associated with the SIP server for any errors.
